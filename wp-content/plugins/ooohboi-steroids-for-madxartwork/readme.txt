An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand madxartwork defaults. Instead of creating new madxartwork Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing. 

= NEW ADD-ON NOW AVAILABLE - SHADOUGH =

From now on you can create the shadow that conforms the shape.

= In the package so far =

1. HARAKIRI 
Allows you to change the writing mode (CSS property writing-mode) of madxartwork's Heading and Text Editor widgets.

2. POOPART
Add an overlay or underlay ghost-element to any madxartwork Widget. By adding a mask image to these, and/or combining them with CSS filters, blend mode, a wow effect is inevitable. Oh, yes, you can also resize and reposition these if you like.

3. OVERLAIZ
From now on, you can move the Background Overlay in any direction, as well as to resize it. Creating overlapping columns is now piece of cake.

4. PAGININI
Your frustration with styling up the posts pagination in madxartwork is now officially over.

5. BREAKING BAD
Tailor the Section columns at will! Set the custom width, height and let them collapse naturally.

6. GLIDER
Generate the slider out of Section and columns with one click only!

7. PHOTOGIRAFFE
Make any Image full-height

8. TELEPORTER
An awesome Coulmn hover controls

9. SEARCH COP
Decide what to search for; posts only, pages only or everything.

10. VIDEOMASQ
Add the SVG mask to the Section video background and let the video play inside any shape

11. BASELINE GRID
Find it uder the Page Settings! It allows you to define the visual grid and thus ensure consistent vertical spacing with your typography and page elements.

12. BUTTER BUTTON
From now on you can design awesome buttons in madxartwork! Forget about those flat, boring and outdated buttons style, Butter Button brings fun! 

13. PERSPEKTIVE
A small set of options that allow you to move widgets in 3D space

14. SHADOUGH
This extension allows you to create the shadow that conforms the shape.

15. MORE TO COME SOON!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need madxartwork PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of madxartwork and madxartwork PRO.
